## Summary of Accomplishments

1. **Gate 6 Roadmap Specification**: Created `DNK-SPEC-0640_gate6_roadmap_planning.md` defining Gate 6 strategic objectives, post-Gate-5 architectural baseline, rollout blockers, and execution tracks.
2. **Task Forest Tree & Flower**: Created `Tree_11_Gate6_Global_Rollout_Roadmap.md` and `Flower_21_Gate6_Roadmap_Planning.md` establishing ready-to-implement task structures.
3. **Multi-Tenant Rollout Plan**: Structured Gate 6 execution into 3 parallel tracks: Track A (RAG/Knowledge Separation), Track B (Observability/Telemetry), and Track C (Production Hardening).
4. **Handoff Package**: Prepared complete documentation suite inside `DNKOS_MVP/docs/`.
