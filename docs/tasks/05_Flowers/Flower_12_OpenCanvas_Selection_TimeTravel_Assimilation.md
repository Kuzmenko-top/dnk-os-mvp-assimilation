# 🌸 Flower_12: Assimilate Open Canvas Inline Text Selection Box and Time-Travel Version Controls

## 🎯 Purpose
Assimilate winning patterns from open-canvas systems (specifically inline code/text highlighting selection boxes and version histories) into the `Stitch` and `XYFlow` canvases of `DNKOS_MVP`.

## 🛠️ Work Done
- **StitchSelectionToolbar.jsx:** Created a reusable, parent-scoped, floating contextual toolbar that appears on text selection. Implemented quick action triggers for editing, optimizing, and asking.
- **ArtifactRenderer.jsx:** Integrated a Time-Travel Version Controls widget (`[ ◀ v1.0 | v1.1 | v1.2 ▶ ]`) directly into the artifact card header. Enabled duplicate filtration, forward/backward traversal, and instant direct rollbacks.
- **Component Wiring:** 
  - Integrated `StitchSelectionToolbar` inside `StitchCanvasContainer` (restricted to canvas selection context).
  - Integrated `StitchSelectionToolbar` inside `StitchNodeInspector` (restricted to inspector panel context).
  - Configured `StitchPromptDock` to listen to the selection action events and dynamically ingest highlighted snippets into the query input.
- **Verification:** 
  - Created a full Python mock unit/integration test suite at `DNKOS_MVP/tests/verification/test_canvas_timetravel_selection.py`.
  - Executed full pytest run (`20 passed`!).

## ✅ Verification Status
- **Pytest:** `passed`
- **Manual Verification:** Ready to run in Node dev environment.
