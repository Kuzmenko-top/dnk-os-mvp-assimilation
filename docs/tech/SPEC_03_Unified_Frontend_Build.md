## Files Created
- package.json: Defines dependencies and scripts.
- pages/index.js: Basic homepage placeholder.
- public/: Directory for static assets (to be added).
- styles/: Directory for CSS styles (to be added).

## Setup Steps
1. Initialized npm project with npm init -y.
2. Installed core dependencies: next@latest, react@18, react-dom@18.
3. Created the basic page structure under pages/.
4. Configured npm scripts for development, build, and start.

## Next Steps
- Implement the three zones using appropriate libraries (ReactFlow for canvas, xterm.js for terminal, etc.).
