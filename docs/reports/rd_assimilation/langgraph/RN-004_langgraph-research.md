# 🧬 SOTA Research: LangGraph & MCP Adapters (RN-004)

Research of state-of-the-art agent coordination frameworks from the `langchain-ai` organization, specifically focusing on `langgraph` and `langchain-mcp-adapters` for DNK OS Core.

## 📋 Research Metadata

  - `langchain-ai/langgraph` (39.3k+ stars) - Stateful multi-agent orchestrator.
  - `langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters` (3.6k+ stars) - Model Context Protocol adapters.
- **Status:** Completed & Ready for Integration.
- **Key Abstractions:** StateGraph, Checkpointing, Interrupt-Before/After, MCP Tool Converters.

## 🔍 State-of-the-Art Analysis & Core Findings

### 1. Stateful Multi-Agent Graph (LangGraph Pattern)
Unlike standard linear chains or simple DAGs (which cannot handle cycles), LangGraph introduces a stateful graph executor where:
- **Shared State:** Graph nodes read from and write to a centralized shared state (`TypedDict` or Pydantic model).
- **Reducer Functions:** State properties can accumulate updates over time using custom reducers (e.g. `Annotated[list, add_messages]`), allowing seamless tracking of chat history, tool outputs, or file edits across agent cycles.
- **Loops & Conditional Routing:** Nodes can route dynamically using conditional edges based on state values, allowing true iterative problem-solving and self-healing.

### 2. Resilient Checkpointing (State Persistence)
- LangGraph integrates a durable checkpointing system (`BaseCheckpointSaver`, `SqliteSaver`, `MemorySaver`).
- This allows thread-based conversation isolation, time-travel (rolling back to prior steps), and instant crash recovery.
- For DNK OS, this aligns perfectly with `SCONES` cognitive memory and session caching, ensuring that agent execution can survive crashes or system restarts.

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
- `langchain-mcp-adapters` bridge standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients/servers and LangChain tools.
- It dynamically maps MCP schemas (tools, resources, prompts) to native LangChain tool definitions.
- This allows agents to seamlessly interact with host services (like Postgres DB, Obsidian Vault, or Docker Engine) without custom adapter code.
