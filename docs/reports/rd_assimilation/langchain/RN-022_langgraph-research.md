# 🧪 Research Report: LangGraph State Graphs & Orchestration (RN-022)

## 📌 Executive Summary
`langchain-ai/langgraph` is the industry-standard library for building cyclic, stateful, multi-agent workflows. Unlike strict DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) pipelines, LangGraph introduces **Cyclic State Graphs**, enabling loops, iterative reasoning, human-in-the-loop interventions, and durable checkpointing.

## 🔑 Key Extracted Architectural Patterns

### 1. State-Centric Execution (TypedDict / Pydantic State)
- The entire graph execution revolves around a shared `State` object passed between nodes.
- Reducer functions (e.g. `operator.add` or annotated merge functions) allow nodes to append or update specific state keys without overwriting existing state.

### 2. Nodes & Directed Edges
- **Nodes:** Pure or side-effecting Python functions `(state) -> dict_update`.
- **Direct Edges:** Unconditional transitions from Node A to Node B.
- **Conditional Edges:** Dynamic routing functions `(state) -> str` that decide the next node based on current state attributes (e.g. router decisions, tool calls vs. completion).

### 3. Durable Checkpointing & Memory
- `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface records state snapshots after every node execution step.
- Enables thread-scoped persistent conversations, time-travel debugging, and rollback capabilities.

### 4. Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Interrupts
- `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` breakpoints pause execution before or after specified nodes.
- Allows human approval, parameter edits, or state overrides before resuming execution.

### 5. Hierarchical Subgraph Composition
- Subgraphs can be embedded inside parent graph nodes.
- Facilitates team-of-teams multi-agent architectures where each subagent owns its internal state machine.
