## 🔍 Core Findings & Architectural Insights

### 1. LangGraph State Machines (`agent/graphs/*.py`)
`open-swe` uses specialized LangGraph state graphs representing closed software engineering loops:
- **Repo Analysis State:** Scans codebase, parses AST signatures, constructs context graphs.
- **Planner Node:** Formulates candidate edit plans and test scenarios.
- **Executor & Patch Node:** Generates file modifications using unified diffs or targeted block replacements.
- **Verifier Node:** Executes test suites in a isolated runtime and triggers self-healing retries upon failure.

### 2. Event-Driven Dispatcher (`agent/dispatch.py`)
- Dispatches user issues / GitHub PR tasks to target agent workflows.
- Packs repository context (relevant files, AST trees, git status) into compact context windows.
- Filters irrelevant files to optimize context consumption.

### 3. Async Task Scheduler (`agent/scheduler.py`)
- Handles background execution of long-running coding jobs.
- Implements concurrency throttles, queue prioritization, and job status event streaming.

### 4. Structured Prompts & Diff Engineering (`agent/prompt.py`)
- Standardized prompt schemas enforcing strict diff structures (`*** Begin Patch ... *** End Patch`).
- Error context feedback loops: feeds test execution traces directly back into the prompt for iterative fixing.

### 5. Sandboxed Runtime Execution (`agent/runtime/`)
- Isolates untrusted code execution inside containerized Docker runtimes.
- Prevents host filesystem pollution and enforces resource bounds (CPU, memory, timeout).

## 🛡️ Alignment with DNK OS Standards
- Directly aligns with DNK OS `DNKLangGraphAdapter` and `DNKLangChainAdapter`.
- Enforces Docker-only runtime execution matching DNK OS zero host pollution mandate.
