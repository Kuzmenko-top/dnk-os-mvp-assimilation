# Three Zones UI Report

## Overview
This report describes the implementation of the three interactive zones in the DNKOS_MVP frontend.

## Zones Implemented

### Zone 1: Canvas Editor
- Located at `components/CanvasEditor.jsx`
- Uses ReactFlow (@xyflow/react) for interactive node-based canvas
- Displays three nodes: DNK OS Kernel, Gerych Swarm, Shopify Service
- Includes background grid and controls for zooming/panning

### Zone 2: Hermes Terminal and Chat
- Located at `components/TerminalChat.jsx`
- Features a live chat interface with Gerych
- Users can type commands and receive simulated responses
- Monospace font and dark theme for terminal-like appearance

### Zone 3: Telemetry and Swarm Map
- Located at `components/TelemetryMap.jsx`
- Displays swarm metrics: active agents, token usage, estimated cost, core status
- Uses monospace font and dark background

## Layout
- The zones are arranged in a flex container in `pages/index.js`
- Canvas Editor takes 2/3 of the width (left side)
- Terminal Chat and Telemetry Map are stacked vertically on the right side (each taking 1/2 of the height)

## Dependencies Installed
- `@xyflow/react`: For the canvas editor
- `lucide-react`: For icons (though not used in the current implementation, available for future use)
- `framer-motion`: For animations (available for future use)

## Verification
- The development server is running on port 3001
- The UI loads without errors
- All three zones are visible and functional

## Next Steps
- Implement actual functionality for the terminals (connect to backend)
- Add real-time data updates for telemetry
- Enhance the canvas with more node types and interactions
- Add authentication and authorization
